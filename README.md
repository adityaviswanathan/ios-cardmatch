ios-cardmatch
=============

Simple card matching app I built to learn iOS

## Gameplay

This is a pretty basic card matching game. To play, select a card and then select a different card. If the two cards have the same suit or rank, you get points. The game is designed such that matching cards of the same rank gives more points. There is a (trivial) cost to guessing.

The game can also be played in 3 card mode, which means that you have the opportunity to select three cards instead of two. The same rules as above apply. Naturally, it is easier to come up with a match with three draws, so 3 card mode is more basic than 2 card mode. 

## Stuff I learned building this
- General Xcode interface
- Objective-C semantics
- Object-oriented patterns of iOS
- MVC model of iOS/Xcode
- UI elements and how to modify them in Xcode
